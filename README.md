This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: calling a method that might not be defined.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.as` file shows how to fix it by checking for null or undefined before calling the method. This error often arises from issues with class instantiation, inheritance or dynamically accessing methods from external libraries.
